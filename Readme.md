# Captain Cook's General Discord Bot of Fun (CCGDBF)

## Background

A simple Discord bot based on the fantastic 'An Idiots Guide' : https://anidiots.guide/
This is my first forray into Javascript so don't judge my code too harshly. 

I've set this bot up on a roleplaying server I help run to learn about bots in general. 
I've added a couple of commands specific to the server and will likely expand as I learn more:
 - Display a custom embed with the current weather of the Server.
 - Set the weather on the specified weather channels. 
 - Print a formatted 7-day weather forecast for the server
 - Print a jobs board based on a file format stored in the 'jobs' folder

 
## What's next?!

  - I have some code for setting moon phases for the server
  - I want to do some general role play specific commands, maybe mood setting, scenario descriptions.
  - There is also the thought of making like a news/annoucement feature that advertises current events, or goings on around the server... not sure what that will look like, but sounds like a challenge.
